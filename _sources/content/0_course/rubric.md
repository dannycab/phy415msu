# Project Rubrics

## Preliminary (For first out of class project)

We have worked together to define elements of a rubric that matter for making physical models. These elements appear as part of major learning goals below. 

| Goal                                                      | Fractional Importance |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------:|
| Investigate physical systems                              |          0.30         |
| Construct and document a reproducible process             |          0.10         |
| Use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches   |          0.30         |
| Provide evidence of the quality of their work             |          0.10         |
| Collaborate effectively                                   |          0.20         |

### Goal: Investigate physical systems (0.30)
 
 - How well does your computational essay <mark>predict</mark> or <mark>explain</mark> the system of interest?
 - How well does your computational essay allow the user to <mark>explore</mark> and <mark>investigate</mark> the system?

### Goal: Construct and document a reproducible process (0.10)

- How well does your computational essay <mark>reproduce</mark> your results and claims?
- How  <mark>well documented</mark> is your computational essay?

### Goal: Use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches (0.30)

- How well does your computational essay document your <mark>assumptions</mark>?
- How well does your computational essay produce an <mark>understandable</mark> and <mark>parsimonious</mark> model?
- How well does your computational essay explain the <mark>limitations</mark> of your analysis?

### Goal: Provide evidence of the quality of their work

- How well does your computational essay <mark>present</mark>  the case for its claims?
- How well <mark>validated</mark>  is your model?

### Goal: Collaborate effectively

- How well did you <mark>share</mark>  in the class's knowledge?
  - How well is that documented in your computational essay?
- How well did you <mark>work with your partner</mark> ? *For those choosing to do so*
